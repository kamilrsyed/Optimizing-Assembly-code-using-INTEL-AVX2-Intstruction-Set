# Optimizing-Assembly-code-using-INTEL-AVX2-Intstruction-Set
C code performs vector addition on very large sized vectors (in this case, upto 2^16). Microsoft Visual Studio 32-bit compiler and Linux 64-bit gcc compiler was used. Compiler generated assembly code was optimized using INTEL AVX2 instruction set to reduce execution time
